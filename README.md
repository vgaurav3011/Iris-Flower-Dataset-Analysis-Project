# Iris-Flower-Dataset-Analysis-Project
## Dataset URL: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris
Created univariate and multivariate plots to define the individual attributes and the relationships between them
## Evaluated the algorithms for selection of best model using the follwoing process:
1. Separate out validation dataset
2. Set up the test harness to use 10 cross split validation
3. Build five different models to predict species from the flower measurements
4. Select the best model
## The following classification models were implemented:
### 1.Logistic Regression Classifier
### 2.Linear Discriminant Analysis Classifier
### 3. KNeighbors Classifier
### 4. Decision Tree Classifier
### 5. Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier
### 6. Support Vector Machine
## Out of these the KNeighbors Classifier using K-means algorithm gave 0.90 accuracy that is upto 90 percent
### Predictive Analysis carried out using K-Neighbors Classifier and the valid plottings relevant to analysis are in the repository
